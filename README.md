# Logistic-Regression

A very simple Logistic Regression classifier implemented in python. The sklearn.linear_model library is used to import the LogisticRegression class. A classifier object of that class was created and fitted with the X_Train and Y_Train varibles.

A confusion matrix was implemented to test the prediction accuracy of the classifier. The confusion matrix function was imported from sklearn.metrics
